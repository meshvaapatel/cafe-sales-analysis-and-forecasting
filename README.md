### 📌 Project Overview 

Exploring the Cafe Sales – Dirty Data dataset using a complete EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process. We start by understanding the data and cleaning it to fix missing values, mismatched entries, and inconsistencies. Then, we analyze key metrics using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. We apply feature engineering, handle outliers, and use column and power transformations to improve data quality. We also perform binning, split complex columns, and build new features to make the data more useful. The goal is to find clear, actionable insights that can help improve café operations and support smart, data-driven decisions.

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE

The primary goal of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Cafe Sales – Dirty Data dataset to uncover key trends and insights that drive sales and customer engagement.
This project aims to --
  * Clean and structure messy sales data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability.
  * Explore customer behavior, product preferences, and payment trends across different café locations.
  * Uncover hidden patterns in item popularity, spending behavior, and time-based sales fluctuations.
  * Translate insights into actionable strategies that can improve product offerings, inventory planning, and marketing campaigns.
  * Support café businesses in making data-driven decisions to boost operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into strategic knowledge that empowers businesses to thrive in a competitive landscape.
