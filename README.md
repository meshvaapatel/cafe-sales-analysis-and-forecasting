# ðŸ“Š Cafe Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis

An end-to-end data analytics project that transforms raw, messy transactional data into actionable business intelligence. This project encompasses a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Python** and an interactive **Power BI** Dashboard for visualization.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the "Cafe Sales â€“ Dirty Data" dataset to uncover key trends, patterns, and actionable insights. By transforming raw transactional data into strategic knowledge, this project aims to empower the cafÃ© to make smarter, data-driven decisions.

- **Clean and Prepare Data** - Structure and sanitize messy sales data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability for analysis.  
- **Uncover Actionable Insights** - Identify key trends related to customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency.  
- **Analyze Key Business Drivers** - Explore customer preferences, payment trends, item popularity, spending behavior, and time-based sales fluctuations.  
- **Develop Strategic Recommendations** - Translate analytical findings into actionable strategies that can improve product offerings, optimize inventory, and enhance marketing campaigns.

### ðŸ”„ Workflow Process

The analysis follows a structured process as detailed in the Jupyter Notebook

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Overview** - The dataset was loaded to understand its structure, shape (15,000 rows, 8 columns), and initial data types.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - This phase involved correcting inconsistent values (e.g., "ERROR", "UNKNOWN"), converting data types, and imputing missing data using appropriate methods (mode, mean, median, and linear regression).
3.  **Outlier Detection & Capping** - Outliers in the `total_spent` column were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and capped to prevent skewing the analysis.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Both univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to explore data distributions and relationships between variables.
5.  **Feature Engineering** - New features (`day`, `month`, `is_weekend`) were created from the date column, and categorical variables were encoded for analysis.
6.  **Data Visualization & Insight Generation** - Findings were visualized to generate actionable business recommendations.
