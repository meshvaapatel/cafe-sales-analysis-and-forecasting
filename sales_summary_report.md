## **Cafe Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis Report**



##### **OBJECTIVE**



To uncover key trends, patterns, and actionable insights in café sales data to support data-driven decision-making related to customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency.



##### **Data Overview**



The Dirty Cafe Sales dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in a cafe. This dataset is intentionally "dirty," with missing values, inconsistent data, and errors introduced to provide a realistic scenario for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It can be used to practice cleaning techniques, data wrangling, and feature engineering.

✅ **Business Recommendations**



1\. Focus on Best-Selling Items



    - Certain products consistently dominate sales volume across locations.

    - Recommendation - Promote these top items through combo deals, loyalty programs, or seasonal campaigns to boost repeat purchases.



2\. Optimize Inventory by Location



    - Some café branches show significantly higher transaction volumes.

    - Recommendation - Adjust inventory and staff allocation based on location-level performance. Consider scaling up high-performing locations or revisiting underperforming ones.



3\. Leverage Payment Preferences



    - A clear dominance of certain payment methods (e.g., digital wallets or credit cards) is observed.

    - Recommendation - Ensure seamless support for preferred payment methods and incentivize digital payments via cashback or discounts.



4\. Utilize Time-Based Sales Trends



    - Weekends and certain days show spikes in sales, especially for specific items.

    - Recommendation - Launch weekend-specific offers or promotions, and adjust staff schedules to handle peak times.



5\. Understand Customer Behavior Patterns



    - Quantity and total spending are positively correlated, especially with high-value items.

    - Recommendation - Encourage bulk buying by offering quantity-based discounts or “Buy 2 Get 1 Free” deals.



6\. Maintain Clean Data Practices



    - Data inconsistencies like EERROR, UNKNOWN, and mismatched entries were present.

    - Recommendation - Improve front-end data capture systems at POS (Point-of-Sale) to reduce manual errors and ensure reliable reporting.



7\. Monitor Outliers \& Fraud



    - Outliers in total\_spent may represent bulk purchases or errors.

    - Recommendation - Set up automatic anomaly detection to flag transactions significantly outside the norm for review.
